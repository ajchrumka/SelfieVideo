- Supports background music (Doesn't pause Spotify etc)
- Stores photo/video in temp dir 
- Throw oriented code (allows external handling of errors)
- Persistent app authorization
- Animated record button (white to red transition)

### Why use this camera framework
- High [codebeat GPA](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-eonist-hybridcamera-master) 
- Low class scoped variable count (In order to better handle overall state)
- Setup errors can be handled from the POV of the initiator
- Operation errors is handled in the onCapture completion block 
- Callback based (as oppose to delegate based) [More info](https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/why-you-shouldn-t-use-delegates-in-swift-7ef808a7f16b) 
- Easily styleable (The camera view is separate from the UI view)
- No third-party libraries or Sugar
- Entirely programatic (No storyboard)
- Thoroughly documented (Artifacts and sideEffects etc)
- Uses [Linkdin style guide](https://github.com/linkedin/swift-style-guide)

### Notes:
- In order to keep things simple, The UI is CGRect based. Use your own Autolayout distro like SnapKit etc when adding additional UI

### Install:
Open the .xcodeproj file and `cmd + r`   
To use in other projects:   
1. Copy the src folder into your project  (If you don't want the UI, just copy the `cam/` folder)
2. Make sure info.plist has these variables  
 ```

### Example code:   
```swift
self.view = HybridCamView()
view.camView.onPhotoCaptureComplete = { (image:UIImage?,url:URL?,error:Error?) in
   Swift.print("On photo capture complete \(url)")
}
hybridCamView.camView.onVideoCaptureComplete = { (url:URL?,error:Error?) in
   Swift.print("On Video capture complete \(url)")
